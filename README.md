# Finding-the-1000th-fibonacci-number
Finding the 1000th fibonacci number in C and Python in the minimum possible time.
<p> We shall be finding the 1000th Fibonacci number in C using the fastest algo possible.</br>
<br> It has a time complexity of O(log n)</br> </p>

<p> As the names suggest, Fast one has a time complexity of O(n) and the other has a time complexity of O(log n)
  But due to constant value storage, O(n) is faster than O(log n)
